<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Hello, I am Amlaan Bhoi. I am a graduate student of Computer Science in the <a href="https://www.cs.uic.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.uic.edu/">University of Illinois at Chicago</a>. My research interests are in computer vision, time-series prediction, data & text mining. I love reading machine learning papers on <a href="http://www.arxiv-sanity.com/">arxiv-sanity</a> and am always keen on learning something new! I graduated from Amity University with a B.Tech in Computer Science & Engineering in 2017 with First Class honors. Outside classwork, my team won the "Best Microsoft Hack" at HackHarvard 2017 (Cambridge, MA) in Oct 2017. I also dwell around with occasional iOS development and Apple's ARKit to develop augmented reality experiences. Feel free to contact me!</p>
