# 1. **Smartphone/Tablet AR**
The plethora of augmented reality (AR) applications found on most smartphones/tablets today includes apps such as Quiver ([quivervision.com](http://www.quivervision.com)), Pokémon Go ([pokemongo.com](http://www.pokemongo.com)), and even Google Translate ([translate.google.com](http://translate.google.com)).
## Advantages

   (a) **Portability**: Phones and tablets are ultra-portable and allow users to move about, wander, and explore large areas without any major restrictions (battery life is an exception). AR apps running on these devices makes these apps portable as well.

   (b) **Minimal Setup**: Unlike other AR implementations, AR apps require almost zero setup from the user end. The user just needs to download the app from the App Store and run the AR app. The installation portion of the experience is almost non-existent.

   (c) **Fast Updates**: To improve AR app performance or deliver new content, the app developer just needs to add the changes and push an update to the app. This is fast, efficient, and inexpensive for both the developer and the user.
## Disadvantages

   (a) **Information Control**: When AR apps are developed, one concern is the amount of information. How much information should the user be allowed to experience at one time without feeling inundated? The user experience should be clear, concise, and clear of redundant views.

   (b) **Privacy Concerns**: Apps such as Google Translate store the searches or results. This data is fair use for Google to use in their other products when servicing the user. They can share this information with advertisers as well. This raises a concern of privacy and what data should be protected.

   (c) **Limited Functions**: As of right now, there is not much AR apps on smartphones/tablets do besides showing 3D models and replacing text on camera.
## Applications

Various applications of smartphone/tablet AR apps include **education in the classroom, scientific exploration (chemistry, biology), and advertisement**.

# 2. **360 Video**
360 Video implementations include 360fly ([360fly.com](http://www.360fly.com)), YouTube 360 ([youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com)), and nytvr ([nytimes.com/marketing/nytvr](http://www.nytimes.com/marketing/nytvr)).
## Advantages

   (a) **Complete Coverage/Data**: 360 videos allow users to explore the entire scope of the video (one exception is the bottom portion which is the camera itself). A user can see all parts of the video as per his choice. This gives more flexibility and facility to the user on how and what he wants to see.

   (b) **Static Parts**: 360 videos are shot with only one camera without any dolly, pan, or rotation of camera. This minimizes lag that appears on other types of videos that aim to achieve a 360 degree feel. This also removes any jittering in the video and helps stabilize the image.
## Disadvantages

   (a) **Grainy Quality**: 360 videos usually do not have the best quality. This is because these video files are huge (they contain, literally, 360 degree of footage) and space is an issue. Even 360 videos on YouTube on 720p quality setting are never really 720p. Thus, 360 videos suffer from this issue.

   (b) **Compatibility**: These videos also have problems with adapting to new platforms even within the same OS ecosystem. 360 videos developed for YouTube may not work seamlessly with other apps such as nytvr. These videos must be converted to the specified format and thus compatibility is an issue.
## Applications

Various applications of 360 video apps include **astronomy (star gazing, cosmic exploration) and live streaming events/news.**.

# 3. **Google Cardboard**
The Google Cardboard and relevant information can be found at [https://vr.google.com/cardboard/](https://vr.google.com/cardboard/).
## Advantages

   (a) **Easy Setup**: The setup for Cardboard is easy as it only requires the HMD, made of cardboard material, and a smartphone with a compatible VR app installed. At most, you might be required to assemble the kit if not already preassembled. The only physical setup required is attaching the phone onto the gear and starting the application. This makes it easy for students and kids to explore VR experiences.
   
   (b) **Low Cost/Easily Available**: The standard Google Cardboard costs about $15 and is available at [https://vr.google.com/cardboard/](https://vr.google.com/cardboard/). The cost compared to the experience is justifiable. Google has even open sourced their design so anyone can download the kit and manufacture their own Cardboard [vr.google.com/cardboard/manufacturers/](https://vr.google.com/cardboard/manufacturers/).
## Disadvantages

   (a) **Lack of Content**: Currently, applications available for Google Cardboard are still in explorative stages and there has not been any application aimed towards a daily driver functionality. Development for the platform is also slow and esoteric.
   
   (b) **Low Performance/Resolution**: The Cardboard gear does not provide the best VR experience as it is limited by the phone’s hardware as well as low-tech VR mount. Many count the Google Cardboard as Google’s effort to understand how and why customers want to use VR applications. This is really helpful for developers but not so much for users.
   
   (c) **Simulation Sickness**: Simulation sickness is a very real problem with Google Cardboards. There have been instances of people experiencing simulation sickness when using the Cardboard for more than 15 minutes at a time. This can be attributed to the difference between VR reality and actual reality.
## Applications

Various applications of Google Cardboard include **education, light-weight games, and delivering quick news clips**.

# 4. Microsoft HoloLens
The Microsoft HoloLens and relevant information can be found at [microsoft.com/en-us/hololens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens).
## Advantages

   (a) **Low Latency/High Performance**: HoloLens really provides a low latency experience. The game I played (scorpions), had fast reactions and quick display refresh. This contributes to a lack of nausea or headaches. The games/applications running on HoloLens rarely suffer from lag and run smoothly. Of course, it also helps if the applications are coded efficiently.
   
   (b) **Great Visualization of Data/Games**: The amount of detail included in the augmented reality demo brings promise to great visualization of data. The HoloLens can be more than a device to demo games or show off cool 3D models. They can be used for comprehensive data exploration.
## Disadvantages

   (a) **Limited Field of View**: One disadvantage would be the limited field of view I experienced when running the AR game. Maybe it was the demo itself, but the AR field of view felt limited and a bit detached from the real background.

   (b) **Restricted Portability**: The biggest disadvantage to HoloLens yet is the fact that you cannot use it out and about. You need it to be connected to a computer for it to run.
## Applications

Various applications of Microsoft HoloLens include **AR gaming, mixed reality experience, and even computer functions such as browsing, listening to music, and more.**.

# 5. HTC Vive
The HTC Vive and relevant information can be found at [vive.com/us/](https://www.vive.com/us/).
## Advantages

   (a) **Complete Immersion VR**: The HTC Vive really provides the full picture in terms of Virtual Reality. The games played in the EVL lab gave a sense of that. You become completely detached from reality and are immersed in VR. You do not feel any major lag or glitches.
   
   (b) **Room-scale VR Tracking**: The Vive’s biggest advantage is its complete room-scale VR tracking. This means, you can move about the room in VR as you would do in the real room you are standing in. This is a big advantage over its rival the Oculus Rift, but the Rift is also catching up in that field.
   
   (c) **Intuitive and easy controls**: The Vive has two controllers with easy to use and easily accessible buttons. These buttons have their place in usage when the VR game/app is run. There are no difficult to access or complicated controls for the user.
   
   (d) **Open sourced development/content**: Finally, the Vive’s development and content is open-sourced and is accessible to all. In contrast, Oculus Rift has some exclusive content which deters developers from developing for that platform.
## Disadvantages

   (a) **Requires expensive, high performance build**: The biggest disadvantage as of today is the Vive’s need to be connected to a powerful computer system. A sample build today would require an Intel i5-7500, GeForce GTX 1060 3GB GPU, 1TB HDD, 8GB ram, and a decent CPU cooler.
   
   (b) **Safety Hazard**: There is also the issue with safety. There are countless occurrences of VR accidents (or fails) that show how the Vive can be dangerous if not used properly and with appropriate caution. This one video compiles a few of these accidents: [youtu.be/ask3K_wiiKg](https://youtu.be/ask3K_wiiKg).
## Applications

Various applications of HTC Vive include **VR gaming, education for adults, and data exploration**.

# 6. CAVE2
The CAVE2 was developed at UIC and related information can be found at [evl.uic.edu/entry.php?id=2016](https://www.evl.uic.edu/entry.php?id=2016).
## Advantages

   (a) **Immersive Experience**: The CAVE2 system provides one of the immersive and encapsulating experiences for the user. The applications used in the demos really flaunted the variety of applications the CAVE2 can manage. There are 72 screens with 4 screens vertically stacked. The demo with the chemistry molecule as well as the NASA Mars simulation showed the extent to which CAVE2 can capture the user’s field of view.
   
   (b) **High Performance**: CAVE2 is equipped with multiple processors linked to a master CPU that controls their synchronization. All this ends up with a system that can display data intensive models such as the 3D image point capture demo.
   
   (c) **Openness**: The system has shown how eclectic its range of applications is. Anyone developing VR applications can run it on CAVE2 with modifications. There are not many restrictions to port applications to CAVE2.
## Disadvantages

   (a) **Heavy CPU/GPU Processing**: One downside would be the amount of processing CPUs and GPUs have to do to push all those pixels onto the screens. The simulation itself would require heavy processing and a complicated setup. This is definitely not a easy, portable, or light application of VR.

   (b) **Occlusion Issues**: The demo with the Egyptian 360 images showed there were issues with occlusion. However, that can be attributed more to the data collection methods rather than the actual system.
## Applications

Various applications of CAVE2 include **data exploration (MARS demo, chemistry demo) and widescreen images**.
