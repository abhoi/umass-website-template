For two weeks, I will discuss about two technologies that I found interesting and were discussed in class by fellow students. I will present my views on the technology, a brief introduction to the technology, the pros/cons, applications, and finally a conclusive thought. Let us get started on the first one.

## Pimax 8K

Pimax 8K is a VR headset developed by Pimax. Pimax is a company founded by a team of VR enthusiasts in San Jose, CA that develops high end VR headsets. They started with the Pimax 4k [(VR in 4K resolution)](https://www.pimaxvr.com/en/4k/) and made it commercially viable. Their next project is the Pimax 8k. Now, at first glance, this may look like some ordinary VR headset like the HTC Vive or Oculus Rift. However, there are some careful differences between the Pimax 8k and others. We'll go over these differences in the pros/cons section of the review. The one great thing I liked about this project was the [kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pimax8kvr/pimax-the-worlds-first-8k-vr-headset) effort. As of this post's date of writing, they have secured $4.2 million in funding! If the product was not genuine or really helpful, they would never have gotten the public trust for a crowdsourcing funding effort such as that.

Let us look at the pros and cons of the product.

### PROS vs CONS

First, the pros:

1. **7680x2160 resolution:** This is important because VR headsets of today lack the clarity or crispness in viewing. A higher resolution also means a more immersive sense of VR to the end user. We do not want to see a pixelated view of the virtual world as it would detach us further from sense of reality. We want the VR world to feel as natural and real as the real world.

2. **200Â° Field of Vision:** A wider field of vision means the user is not limited to the restricted FOV of today's headsets. Increasing the field of view also gives the user access to peripheral vision. This enables the user to see movement and actions that are not directly in the line of sight. This also gives a more realistic sense of vision than normal headsets.

3. **90Hz Refresh Rate!**: This, for me, is one of the most impressive feats for this piece of technology. This is because we want to ensure the user feels almost zero latency or lag when in the VR world. A higher refresh rate (a gamer will tell you why it matters) results in more responsive object reactions, actions, and responses from the user.

4. **No ScreenDoor effect: **: The ScreenDoor effect refers to the terribly exaggerated pixel lines that are shown to user in small resolution devices. It can get really annoying after a while as it removes the facade of virtual worlds. Also, no screendoor effect means drastically minimized **motion sickness**.

Now, the cons:

1. **Hardware Requirements**: The hardware requirements required to drive this system is infeasible for normal day use by a far mile. The company recommends running the headset on at least a Nvidia GTX 970 GPU (for 8KX you need **GTX 1080 Ti/Volta/Tesla!**), internal upscaling, and Brainwarp. This can be hard for people to acquire to run the headset. They may rather just prefer a HTC Vive or Oculus Rift to this when it comes to convenience.

2. **Availability/Funding**: Most of these kinds of projects get funded from crowdsourcing which hinders venture capitalists from investing in such companies. This would probably force the company to stop making the product due to the constraints. Secondly, the availability of this product says February 2018 but could easily be delayed due to production resource constraints. Pimax really needs to sort these issues out before declaring it a success.

### Applications

Where can a product like this be useful?

1. **Military**: A great application would be in the military where even a miniscule detail can be the discriminatory factor between someone's life or death. Military personnel usually look for terrorists or bombs or IEDs and technology like this can make it easier for them to spot such things. Training recruitments to simulate real, war-like conditions is another way the military can use them.

2. **Medical**: The medical industry can definitely benefit from the 8K resolution as they need to usually be insanely precise with their procedures. This applies heavily to surgeons performing intricate procedures.

3. **Art**: The art industry can definitely benefit from the extra saturation, field of view, and resolution to explore and immerse themselves into artwork.

There are many applications possible for this technology and can be extended to almost any field.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, I believe Pimax has come up with a brilliant product with great aspirations. They have raised the bar when it comes to resolution, refresh rates, quality, and precision. This is almost like a warning to big VR headset manufacturers to step up their standards of what they consider virtual reality. However, this also brings the problem of audience scope. Currently, the Pimax 8K is geared towards VR enthusiasts and the VR development and education industry. In no way is it ready for mass-scale production and end user consumption. I hope these problems can be broken through as it is a great product.

## Neurable: Control VR with your mind

[![PROJECT1](http://img.youtube.com/vi/47WHqDNckI8/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47WHqDNckI8)

![Neurable](http://www.gmonna.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/neurable.jpeg)

Neurable is a VR company that aims to let users control actions and interactions in VR using brain patterns. They say it is a "brain-computer" interface that allows people to control the software using only brain activity. At first consideration, this seems far fetched and something possible only in the far future. However, a closer look reveals that the technology actually makes lots of ground and is quite good. Basically, the technology allows you to record and analyze brain activity and translate it into commands/functions/actions. For intent driven interactions, the system uses machine learning techniques. Let us have a look at the pros vs cons.

### PROS vs CONS

First, the pros:

1. **Portable**: The system is portable and can be attached to any VR device. This means, compatibility is not an issue. It can be ported to an Oculus Rift or a HTC Vive. This removes lots of restrictions many other VR additions have. Also, making it more compatible allows faster adoption and lesser restrictions towards fast implementation.

2. **Learnable (ML)**: The system uses a classifier to classify EEG control signals in real time into interactions. With enough signals as a training dataset, creating the classifier would not have been that difficult.

3. **Easy of Use**: The whole point of using the brain and thoughts instead of controllers is to remove the learning curve in learning how a controller for a VR system works. Most of the times, new users in VR get confused as to what each button does on the controller. For example, the HTC vive controller has the Trigger button, the side button, and the touchpad button. For us, it is simple now because we have spent significant time with it. But, for new users, it can be difficult to adjust quickly. However, with a technology like Neurable, interacting with the VR world can simply be to just think what you want to do and do it in VR.

Now, the cons:

1. **Heavy Equipment**: The hardware portion of the system is quite bulky and requires some setup for the headset. As you can see in the image above, there is quite a bit of setup attached the the vanilla HTC vive headset. This can bring lots of problems including disorientation and feelings of discomfort. The company says they are trying to bring down the hardware requirements, but that can only be possible after optimizing the software.

2. **Interaction Limitations**: There is only so much data and information you can get from EEG signals. This can be a limitation in some VR applications. One such application would be when playing a fast paced game and when interactions need to be instantaneous. Any delay, and that would result in a sub-optimal performance for any user.

3. **Only Conceptual**: Some have provided skepticism as to if the system can be commercially viable. To get a product to run on the mainstream, consumer end level, you need to achieve a certain level of fault tolerance and efficiency which this product seems too far away from even in the near future. We can only wait and see where this technology goes.

### Applications

A product like this can be used in applications such as:

1. **Data Visualization**: Sometimes, picking up stuff and moving objects around in VR when performing data visualization can be painfully slow and obtruse. Just thinking about where to place the data, where to go inside a data, which angle to view the information can be a great leap forward for scientists in every field.

2. **Art**: Artists can now think about how they want the brush strokes to go in VR so that they can more naturally paint something. This would work well because they do not really care that much about latency and they only care about precision.

3. **Medical**: With exception to emergency and surgery, I think this technology would work well to train doctors and even patients on how to work and think in the field. This could work great for psychologists too.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, I think Neurable is a great step forward in the field of marrying the two disciplines of neural technology and virtual reality. However, in reality, it is difficult seeing this project go to a fruitful end. The most possible scenario seems that this technology would just be remembered as a hyped implementation that went nowhere and was cool as a conceptual and at max a research based idea. It would take a miracle for Neurable to come to the mainstream.
