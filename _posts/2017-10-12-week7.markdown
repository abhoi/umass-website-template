This week, I got to play around with an **Augmented Reality** (AR) application! I downloaded and played around with [Ikea Place](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ikea-place/id1279244498?mt=8) application on iOS. The main motive of the application is to allow userâ€™s to place virtual furnitures (real, manufactured furnitures but in virtual, 3D format) inside their houses. Actually, this is a really smart idea by IKEA to show users how their furnitures will go in their homes. This makes users more keen to purchase the item. Technically though, how does it stack up? Is it the game changer in the AR smartphone game?

For the first experiment, I took my living room as an example. I did not just want to take an image and show the screenshot, so I took a screen recording and converted it into a **video**! The screen recording is as follows:

Going through the recording, one thing missing are the yellow dots that appear when you first calibrate the application to the room. Because I did this once before, the yellow dots did not appear and the **calibration** was pretty much instant. How did the calibration and tracking do? As you can see, when I added the first object, the application was smart enough to track the **floor** with respect to **distance** and **scale** automatically. I would say that is an intricately designed feature. That really bumps up the reality factor.

What else? As you can see with the third object, the application figured out that the table was at a higher elevation and placed the object at the appropriate height! In my books, that is a great implementation of AR. The application is not static or 2D in **perspective** as many AR applications are (even though they say 3D, their only their objects are 3D).

Another great thing is the **scale** of the objects themselves. They are not obnoxiously big nor minutely small. They are of appropriate size even when you place them nearer or further from you. So, an application like this must have some limitations, right? Let us see.

For my second experiment, I took the application outside in low lighting. Yes, the Agent Smith to modern smartphone cameras. The image for that experience is:

As visible, the application suffered **accuracy** and **depth** in low light as expected. The objects were not to size and they failed in providing any accurate shadow directions. One of the objects even failed to find **true ground** and kind of hovered in mid air. I believe better detection methods in images can solve the problem.

Instead of drooling on the negatives, let us see the futuristic uses of these applications. Companies in the future can use this technology in various marketing schemes. [Pokemon Go](http://www.pokemongo.com) has very successfully used AR technology to make user experience **immersive**. However, when speaking of customer base, I believe big manufacturing companies can use this with respect to maintenance of warehouses and factories. Many of these companies are building huge products (airplanes, cars) and require up to date information wherever relevant. Even though AR HMDs may be a direction to go, I feel these AR applications on smartphones are the immediate future for this technology.

One more application could be fast food companies using this to hold **scavenger hunts or product placements** in advertisement boards and have users point their phones on their to interact with the billboard. Immense possibilities abound.

That was my look at a current AR application from IKEA and the future use of these applications on smartphones. Especially when smartphone adoption is at its highest [Pew](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/12/evolution-of-technology/).
